how it works:
1.Triggerbot Detects Target: The triggerbot monitors the screen and finds a target.
2.Client Sends Command: The triggerbot, acting as a client, sends a message (such as a key press) to the server.
3.Server Executes Action: The server in port.py receives the command and simulates the necessary key press (like the fire button) on the server's machine.
4.Result in Game: The game registers the key press and fires the weapon.
5.if you rage it = ban,this program basically undetectable for a short period because its my remake of the public triggerbot,so its same mechanisms and different code.

# bad people are smart,good people are smart too, they know how to break the obstacles, so are you the normal people?
